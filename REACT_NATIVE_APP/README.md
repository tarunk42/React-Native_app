# React-Native_app
A react-native app for experimentation while I'm learning.
##  To get started with react-native:
### > Install node- the react-native cli, a JDK, and Android Studio(if you wish to start with android dev obv!)
### > Next step is to set up the jdk environment and the android sdk environment. You can follow the steps provided at [Setting Up environment.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
### > Once environment is setup:
#### --> **npx react-native init Andy**
### > This will create your project folder and dependecies.
### > To start and Run the project "cd" into procet folder:
#### --> **npx react-native run-android**
## > VOILA!
